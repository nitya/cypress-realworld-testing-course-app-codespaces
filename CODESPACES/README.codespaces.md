# Real World Testing With Cypress - On GitHub Codespaces

 - The [Cypress Realworld Testing Course App](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-testing-course-app) repository contains the default sample used for the [Real Wotld Testing With Cypress](https://learn.cypress.io/) course. It specifies _Visual Studio Code_ as the preferred environment, but provides manual installation instructions for setup.
 - The primary objective of this fork is to instrument the project with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/) (Dev Container) to make that development environment repeatable and consistent by default. 
  - The secondary objective is to create a dedicated [Visual Studio Code Profile](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles) for Cypress testing that has useful Visual Studio Code Extensions and settings configured for optimal productivity.
 
## 1. Setting Up GitHub Codespaces

The [Real World Testing With Cypress - Course App](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-testing-course-app) is written in TypeScript/JavaScript, and built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.dev). 

### 1.1 Configure Dev Container
 1. Install the [Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
 2. From Command Palette: find `Add Dev Container Configuration ..`
 3. Select: `Node.js & TypeScript` as the target
 4. Pick a valid Node.js version: I chose `node:1-18-bookworm`
 5. Save the file => should create `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

<br/>

### 1.2 Validate on Local Container

The same devcontainer configuration can be used with both GitHub Codespaces (cloud) and Docker Desktop (local). Let's validate the local setup first:
 1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) if you don't already have it.
 2. Launch it and validate that the Docker dameon is running.
 3. Click the "><" icon at bottom left of VS Code (from _Dev Containers Extension_)
 4. Select "Reopen in Container" option from drop-down menu.

You should see a dialog popup indicating the devcontainer configuration file is being read. Then the VS Code window will restart and you should observe 3 things:
 1. The Docker Desktop is running a container using the image named in `devcontainer.json`
 2. The Visual Studio Code "><" icon now shows `Dev Container @dekstop-linux` = is connected!
 3. The Visual Studio Code terminal shows `node ‚ûú /workspaces/cypress-realworld-testing-course-app-codespaces (start)` indicating it is effectively a shell in the container workspace.

_We now have Visual Studio Code effectively talking to a development environment in a container we configured!_

<br/>

### 1.3 Validate Application in Container

Next, we need to validate that the Cypress real-world course app _runs_ in that container environment. Let's follow [this guidance](https://learn.cypress.io/testing-your-first-application/app-install-and-overview#installing-the-application-1) from the Cypress course to validate that.

```bash
## 1. Check the node version running in terminal
$ node -v
v18.17.0

## 2. Install dependencies
$ npm install

## 3. Start dev server and preview
$ npm run dev
```

You should notice the following:

1. A dialog pops up as shown below, indicating the dev server started up on port 3000.
    ![](01-Run-Dev-Server.png)

2. If you open the VS Code Terminal, you should see console output indicating successful startup.
    ![](01-Run-Terminal-Tab.png)

3. The Ports Tab should show process is live on port 3000 in container _and auto-forwarded to host_
    ![](01-Run-Ports-Tab.png)

4. This means that if you click _Open In Browser_ in dialog above, it will now open the browser in your host (desktop) machine and be able to see the website that was being previewed within the container! Like this:
    ![](02-Open-In-Browser.png)

5. And if you clicked the _Preview In Editor_ button, you instead get the website preview within Visual Studio Code, in a dedicated browser-preview tab. Like this:
    ![](03-Preview-In-Editor.png)

The latter may be useful if you want to modify code in one tab of VS Code, and see the effects in real time in the other tab (titled Simple Browser).


You will notice 3 things:
 1. A dialog will popup on Visual Studio Code with `Your application running on port 3000 is available. See all forwarded ports` and offering 2 options: `Open in Browser` and `Preview in Editor`

The bottom line is: SUCCESS!! üéâ
We have the Cypress Sample App running in a container, and can connect to that development environment from Visual Studio Code on our desktop - and view the dev server hosted site from the Browser on our desktop.

<br/>

### 1.4 Validate Application in GitHub Codespaces.

Let's check to see if we can also run this in a container environment _in the cloud!_. That's GitHub Codespaces. To test this:
 1. Commit these changes to the fork (so devcontainer.json configuration is pushed to repo)
 2. Visit repo in browser, click `Code` dropdown, select `Codespaces` tab üëâüèΩ create a codepaces.
